# Parallel-And-Distributed-Processing
This repository contains a curated collection of code samples, experiments, and implementations related to Parallel and Distributed Processing. It explores various paradigms and technologies that leverage concurrency and hardware acceleration to improve performance and efficiency. Key areas covered include:

Parallel Programming: Core concepts and implementations demonstrating concurrent execution on CPUs.

Multithreading: Shared-memory parallelism using:

Pthreads (POSIX threads) for low-level thread control and synchronization.

OpenMP for high-level, compiler-supported parallelism with simple directives.

GPU Programming: Code samples utilizing CUDA and OpenCL to harness the power of modern GPUs for data-parallel tasks.

Heterogeneous Programming: Integrating CPU and GPU execution to demonstrate task offloading and coordination across different processing units.
